A recreation of the worldwide hit game Rock-Paper-Scissors! One of the projects on The Odin Project.
This is game is only playable in the console currently, however, I will be coming back to this and adding HTML/CSS styles to make this an actual playable game!
By creating this with JavaScript, I learned how to use functions and how to call them from within each other.
